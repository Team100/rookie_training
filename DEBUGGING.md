# Debugging robot code

Robot code is harder to debug than most code. It runs 50 times a second,
on another computer, while things move. Here are the tools, from easiest
to most powerful.

## 1. Read the error

When the code crashes, the console shows a **stack trace**. Read it from
the **top**, and find the first line that mentions one of **your** files.
That's usually where to look.

* What line is it?
* What could be wrong *on that line*? A `NullPointerException` means
  something on that line is `null`. When was it supposed to be set?

## 2. Print

`System.out.printf(...)` shows up in the Driver Station console. It's
quick, but remember `robotPeriodic` runs 50 times a second, so print
only while you're debugging, and take it out afterwards.

## 3. Log and graph

Our loggers (`LoggerFactory`) send values to NetworkTables. Look at them
live in **Glass** or **AdvantageScope**, and graph them over time. A
graph of "what I asked for" next to "what happened" answers most
questions about motors and controllers.

## 4. Use the debugger, in simulation

The VS Code debugger can stop your code on any line and show every
variable. It works best in the [simulator](SIMULATOR.md).

1. Click in the margin to the left of a line number to set a
   **breakpoint** (a red dot). Try the first line of `robotPeriodic()`.
1. `Ctrl+Shift+P` → **WPILib: Simulate Robot Code**.
1. The code stops at your breakpoint. Hover over variables to see their
   values, and use the **Step Over** button to go one line at a time.

Since `robotPeriodic` runs constantly, you'll hit that breakpoint right
away. That's how you know the debugger works.

for more.

## 5. Write a test

If you can pull the logic into a plain method ("given this stick value,
what duty cycle?"), you can test it with a **unit test** in seconds,
without a robot or the simulator. Look in `lib/src/test` for examples.

## General advice

* **Change one thing at a time.**
* **Make a guess, then test it.** "I think the CAN ID is wrong, so the
  motor's log should show errors."
* **Cut the problem in half.** Does it work in sim? With a simpler study?
  With one motor?
* **Check the hardware too:** CAN ID, wiring, battery, enabled? See
  [SSH and checks](SSH_AND_CHECKS.md).
